# Now You See Me, Now You Don’t: Consent-Driven Privacy for Smart Glasses

This repository provides the complete source code for the three-tier architecture of SITARA and the dataset described in the paper.

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SmartGlassesPrivacy
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up input and output folders and store input video in the input folder**:

    ```bash
    mkdir input
    mkdir output
    ```

---

## Changing Input and Output Video Paths

To specify which video to blur and where to save the output, edit the `Config` class in `main.py`. Locate the following lines:

```python
class Config:
    input_video_path = "./input/video.mp4"
    output_video_path = "./output/video.mp4"
    # ...other config options...
```

- Set `input_video_path` to the path of your input video file.
- Set `output_video_path` to the desired path for the blurred output video.

Set other hyperparameters like `OVERLAY_DETECTOR_BOX`, `DISPLAY_VIDEO`, and `SAVE_OUTPUT` as needed.  
Save your changes and run `main.py`.  
You may also use `encrypt.py` in the encryption folder.

---

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate the relevant encrypted metadata, face embedding, and landmark files along with the blurred video in the output directory.

---

### Both these files are an abstraction to allow for easy prototyping and demo. For actual testing, the performance_eval_rpi.py file in the encryption folder was used. The only differences are the use of picamera interface instead of the openCV interface (to support the camera module) and the use of the actual three queue model described in the paper instead of a demo sequential approach in main.py.


## Restoration

To demo the restoration mechanism, navigate to the decryption folder:

```bash
cd decryption
```

Then execute the `ttp_code_cosine.py` file. This file requires that you specify a `DB_PATH` consisting of face images in the output folder, simulating the TTP Database of faces.

```bash
python ttp_code_cosine.py
```

This file will decrypt the relevant keys and then decrypt the embeddings generated initially. It will then match the embeddings with the faces in the database and generate a `final_matching_results.json` file that stores (in reality it would send to the wearer securely) the unencrypted keys in the output folder.

Then execute the `restore.py` file to generate the restored video:

```bash
python restore.py
```

The restored video will be generated in the output folder.

You can also execute the utility file `decrypt_face_blobs_per_id.py`, which will use the encrypted metadata and the TTP private key to decrypt and store the face regions as JPEGs for reference.

## Synthetic Replacement

Warp a video with a synthetic face using `warping.py`, then optionally run **MobileFaceSwap** on the warped result, all from one CLI.

### Prerequisites

- Navigate to the Synthetic Replacement folder.
- Place **MobileFaceSwap** next to `main.py`:
    - `MobileFaceSwap/video_test.py`
    - `MobileFaceSwap/checkpoints/arcface.pdparams` (and any other weights that repo requires)
- Place assets next to `main.py`:
    - `synthetic_faces/` (face images, e.g., `female1.jpg`)
    - `synthetic_landmarks/` (matching `.txt` files with the same stem, e.g., `female1.txt`)
    - `video_colors.json` mapping video basename → RGB  
      Example:
      ```json
      { "blurred": "(29,25,24)" }
      ```

### Expected Landmarks Layout (for the input video)

```
<landmarks_root>/
  <video_basename>/
    face_0/
      frame_0000.txt
      frame_0001.txt
    face_1/
    ...
```

### Run (Single Video)

```bash
python main.py \
  --video "/absolute/path/to/your_video.mp4" \
  --landmarks_root "/absolute/path/to/video_landmarks" \
  --after_swap
```

> You do **not** need to pass `--synth_img_folder`, `--synth_lm_folder`, `--output_root`, or `--mfs_script`; the script uses local folders next to `main.py`.

### Outputs

- `<repo_dir>/<video_name>.mp4` — warped video
- `<repo_dir>/best_match/` — chosen synthetic (image + landmarks + manifest)
- MobileFaceSwap’s swapped result will also be written under `<repo_dir>` (naming per that script).

## Evaluation
### All latency and energy evaluations were done manually for live videos recorded by a plugged pi camera module using the performance_eval_rpi.py file in the encryption folder. It also requires mounting a USB drive in the /mnt/usb folder as described in the paper.

### 📊 Accuracy Evaluation

#### **SITARA_eval.ipynb — Full Accuracy Evaluation Pipeline**

The `SITARA_eval.ipynb` notebook provides a **complete accuracy evaluation framework** for SITARA, enabling in-depth analysis of detection, embedding, and restoration performance. It is designed to reproduce and extend the accuracy results reported in the paper with fully configurable evaluation parameters.
